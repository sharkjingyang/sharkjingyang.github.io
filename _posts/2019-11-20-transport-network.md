# Model of Leaf Venation in Transport Network

-----

**This is a report paper written for a course after our group read and replicated the reference paper. We got the model from the reference and added our own calculating details.**

## Abstract
Leaf venation is a typical example of a complex biological network. In this article, we first study how to create a venation so that the network can reach maximum efficiency. And  numerical calculation shows the pattern of network must be  treelike. We also prove it by mathematical derivation. However, in fact, most of leaf venation have complex network containing lots of loops.

We revise our model to simulate two different events which always happen in  nature: resilience to damage and fluctuation in load. In the first case, we seek the optimal transport network in the presence of random damage by averaging over damage to each link. In the second case, we seek the network that optimizes transport when the load is sparsely distributed. In both cases, results lead to the presence of loops.
